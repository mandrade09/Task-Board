# Third-Party APIs: Task Board

## Third Party APIs: Week 5 Challenge

## Summary of Task
This week my Challenge was to create a simple task board application that allows a team to manage project tasks by modifying starter code. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.


**Note:** 

I received assistance from a tutor assistant on debugging the functions for the datepicker and rendering the task upon saving the task.

Below are the following Challenge requirements according to the 
**User Story** & **Acceptance Criteria**

## User Story

```md
AS A project team member with multiple tasks to organize
I WANT a task board 
SO THAT I can add individual project tasks, manage their state of progress and track overall project progress accordingly
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```md
GIVEN a task board to manage a project
WHEN I open the task board
THEN the list of project tasks is displayed in columns representing the task progress state (Not Yet Started, In Progress, Completed)
WHEN I view the task board for the project
THEN each task is color coded to indicate whether it is nearing the deadline (yellow) or is overdue (red)
WHEN I click on the button to define a new task
THEN I can enter the title, description and deadline date for the new task into a modal dialog
WHEN I click the save button for that task
THEN the properties for that task are saved in localStorage
WHEN I drag a task to a different progress column
THEN the task's progress state is updated accordingly and will stay in the new column after refreshing
WHEN I click the delete button for a task
THEN the task is removed from the task board and will not be added back after refreshing
WHEN I refresh the page
THEN the saved tasks persist
```



## Deploying to GitHub Pages
Along with the above requirements, I created this project and deployed it to GitHub Pages. This included creating a new repository, cloning it to my computer, and using git commands to save and push my code to the GitHub repository. 

Hope you enjoyed reviewing the Blog!  Go ahead and try it out!
